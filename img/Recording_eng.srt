00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,120
Hi, my name is Vincent, and today we're
going to talk about one of my projects.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,580
This is called IT pal. So I by coding this
project,

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,040
and right now I want to put it back to
the, to Figma to make the design

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,740
tweaks.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:28,540
And then I will build the system for that.
To do that, I open the Figma

6
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,460
file.

7
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,760
I open the plugin, it's called

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:51,810
HTML to Design. So you can import

9
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:56,850
the URL on a screenshot, and then the
plugin will

10
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,830
convert it to the design Figma file.

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,460
So as you can see, we have the design file
here. I used this plugin to do

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:15,479
that.

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,560
Then

14
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,300
I need design tokens. First of all,

15
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,040
I need a rule, so I, I, I search on
internet. So someone

16
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,480
already find the, the system rule. So
primitive token, semantic token,

17
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:47,380
responsive token. So res-- semantic token
and responsive token, those

18
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,280
I will

19
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,400
inherit

20
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,660
it from the primitive tokens.

21
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,1000
So I will use

22
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,770
the LLM agents. So then you can see that
by an image, please create a JSON file for

23
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,600
this token,

24
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,350
and then I have

25
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,920
the, the JSON file.

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:21,520
Back to the Figma, I use the plugin, it's
called Tok- Token

27
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,940
Studio for Figma.

28
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,040
I load, I load up the JSON file

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
I me-- I just mentioned,

30
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,540
and then let's see what, what we got.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,600
And then I click Export Style

32
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:47,340
and Variable to Figma.

33
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,240
And voilà, this is what we have. We have
primitive

34
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,180
token, semantic dark, responsive desktop,
responsive mobile.

35
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,100
And semantic dark and responsive desktop
will,

36
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,859
will be inherited from primitive

37
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:17,280
token.

38
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,980
Next, I want to

39
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:38,620
change the design after I make the tweaks.

40
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,540
For example, for the product page,

41
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,580
I always make the change here,

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,100
and in the new designs, I change the batch

43
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,660
considerations.

44
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,220
And you can see it right now

45
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,380
in the light side, it's still considered a
different color.

46
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,180
And, and right click, I copy the link on
the Figma. I

47
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,760
paste it

48
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,680
to the agent and then, "Hey,

49
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,160
can you implement, implement the

50
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,980
new design

51
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,180
of the product page? Follow

52
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,320
the rules I

53
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:46,010
define."

54
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,420
And then you can see that

55
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,580
the LLM, the agents will connect to the
Figma MCP server. So you, you need to

56
00:04:55,580 --> 00:05:02,580
open that bridge.

57
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,990
This is the s--

58
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,080
uh, this is the rules

59
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,300
when I, when I... This is the rule files,

60
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,580
and I just, I just told

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,360
the LLM that just follow the spec from the

62
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,600
general markdown file.

63
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,400
Okay, and after a while, so this is a new

64
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,820
page of a rover page. You can see that

65
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,360
it totally

66
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,680
different from the old versions, so and
especially for the considering patch, it

67
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,080
totally

68
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
have a new color.

69
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:08,320
Here, here it is, the new design is in
the Figma.

70
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:19,039
Okay, thank for listening.
