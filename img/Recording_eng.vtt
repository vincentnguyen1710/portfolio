00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:06.120
Hi, my name is Vincent, and today we're
going to talk about one of my projects.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.580
This is called IT pal. So I by coding this
project,

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.040
and right now I want to put it back to
the, to Figma to make the design

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.740
tweaks.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.540
And then I will build the system for that.
To do that, I open the Figma

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.460
file.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.760
I open the plugin, it's called

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.810
HTML to Design. So you can import

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.850
the URL on a screenshot, and then the
plugin will

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.830
convert it to the design Figma file.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.460
So as you can see, we have the design file
here. I used this plugin to do

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:15.479
that.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.560
Then

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.300
I need design tokens. First of all,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.040
I need a rule, so I, I, I search on
internet. So someone

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.480
already find the, the system rule. So
primitive token, semantic token,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.380
responsive token. So res-- semantic token
and responsive token, those

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:48.280
I will

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.400
inherit

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.660
it from the primitive tokens.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.000
So I will use

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.770
the LLM agents. So then you can see that
by an image, please create a JSON file for

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:06.600
this token,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.350
and then I have

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.920
the, the JSON file.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.520
Back to the Figma, I use the plugin, it's
called Tok- Token

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.940
Studio for Figma.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.040
I load, I load up the JSON file

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.240
I me-- I just mentioned,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.540
and then let's see what, what we got.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.600
And then I click Export Style

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.340
and Variable to Figma.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.240
And voilà, this is what we have. We have
primitive

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.180
token, semantic dark, responsive desktop,
responsive mobile.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.100
And semantic dark and responsive desktop
will,

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.859
will be inherited from primitive

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:17.280
token.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.980
Next, I want to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.620
change the design after I make the tweaks.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.540
For example, for the product page,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.580
I always make the change here,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.100
and in the new designs, I change the batch

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.660
considerations.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.220
And you can see it right now

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.380
in the light side, it's still considered a
different color.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:09.180
And, and right click, I copy the link on
the Figma. I

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.760
paste it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.680
to the agent and then, "Hey,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.160
can you implement, implement the

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:19.980
new design

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.180
of the product page? Follow

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.320
the rules I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:46.010
define."

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.420
And then you can see that

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.580
the LLM, the agents will connect to the
Figma MCP server. So you, you need to

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.580
open that bridge.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.990
This is the s--

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.080
uh, this is the rules

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.300
when I, when I... This is the rule files,

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.580
and I just, I just told

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.360
the LLM that just follow the spec from the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.600
general markdown file.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.400
Okay, and after a while, so this is a new

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.820
page of a rover page. You can see that

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.360
it totally

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.680
different from the old versions, so and
especially for the considering patch, it

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:54.080
totally

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.080
have a new color.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:08.320
Here, here it is, the new design is in
the Figma.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:19.039
Okay, thank for listening.
